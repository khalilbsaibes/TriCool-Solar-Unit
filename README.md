A modular, solar-powered cooling tile designed for off-grid applications in caravans, mobile homes, and compact structures. The unit uses a slanted solar panel, aerogel insulation, and a vertically mounted Peltier cooler to deliver cooling during peak sunlight without any need for batteries.

### üîß Features

* Self-powered active cooling (no battery needed)
* Triangular shape for modular roof tiling
* Aerogel insulation for thermal isolation
* Dual-fan system (internal cool circulation, external heat exhaust)
* Open-source design

### üß± System Overview

**Components:**

* Solar Panel (tilted 30¬∞‚Äì60¬∞)
* Aerogel insulation layer
* Peltier module (TEC1-12706) mounted vertically
* Internal Fan to circulate cooled air
* External Fan & Heatsink to expel hot air
* Copper rod or heat pipe to transfer heat through aerogel (optional)

**Dimensions (Prototype Reference):**

* Triangle base: ~20cm
* Height: ~5cm

### üîÅ Operating Principle

1.  Solar panel generates electricity.
2.  Power feeds the Peltier module and both fans.
3.  Heat is expelled outward by the external fan and heatsink.
4.  The cold side cools air inside the space via the internal fan.
5.  Aerogel prevents heat from the solar panel transferring downward.
