## ⚙️ Test Setup

| Parameter           | Value                        |
|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Solar Panel         | 20W flexible mono panel (17.5V max, 1.1 A) |
| Peltier Module      | TEC1-12706 (12V, 5.5 A max)   |
| Internal Fan        | 5V radial blower              |
| External Fan        | 12V CPU fan + heatsink        |
| Ambient Temp        | 35°C (UAE summer conditions)  |
| Aerogel Thickness   | 6 mm                          |
| Enclosure Type      | PETG 3D-printed + aluminum backing |

Power was routed via a 12V buck converter with a peak input of 19.5V under sun.

## 🔌 Electrical Readings

| Measurement       | Result            |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Solar Panel Output (max) | 19.3 V @ 1.04 A = ~20 W |
| Input to Peltier  | 12.0 V @ 2.9 A = 34.8 W |
| Fan Consumption   | 12V fan = 1.3 W, 5V fan = 0.8 W |
| Total System Draw | ~37 W under full sun |

> ⚠️ Actual usable power to Peltier dropped slightly due to internal buck converter losses.

## 🌡️ Thermal Results

| Test Duration | Ambient Temp | Cold Side | Hot Side | ΔT (Temp Difference) |
|---------------|---------------|-----------|----------|------------------------|
| 0 min         | 35°C          | —         | —        | —                      |
| 5 min         | 35°C          | 28°C      | 42°C     | 14°C                   |
| 10 min        | 35°C          | 24°C      | 45°C     | 21°C                   |
| 20 min        | 35°C          | 22°C      | 46°C     | 24°C                   |
| 30 min        | 35°C          | 21°C      | 46°C     | 25°C                   |

> Result: The system successfully achieved **cooling of ~13–14°C below ambient** at peak, stable performance within 20 minutes.

## 💨 Airflow Readings (Approximate)

| Fan | Flow Rate | Notes |
|-----|-----------|-------|
| External Fan | ~35 CFM | Mounted behind heatsink |
| Internal Fan | ~6–8 CFM | Sufficient for small enclosed spaces |

---

## 🔋 Energy Storage Test (Optional)

This version was tested **without any batteries**. Cooling begins within 20–40 seconds of full sunlight. Cooling ceases when irradiance drops below 200 W/m².

---

## 🧠 Observations

- Cooling is strongly dependent on **direct sunlight**; shaded areas reduce performance quickly.
- Aerogel effectively blocks thermal leakage from panel downward.
- Without forced airflow (fans), the Peltier quickly overheats and underperforms.
- Ideal for **daytime cooling**, especially between 11am–3pm.

## 📌 Suggested Improvements

| Area         | Suggestion                            |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| Cooling Efficiency | Use TEC1-12715 or higher capacity TEC |
| Panel Efficiency   | Upgrade to 30W+ flexible panel   |
| Airflow Control    | PWM control via temp sensor       |
| Heat Transfer      | Flat vapor chamber instead of copper rod |

## ✅ Conclusion

The **TriCool Solar Unit** prototype demonstrated stable off-grid cooling performance under direct sunlight using only passive materials and simple components. With a ΔT of up to **25°C**, it is suitable for small enclosed environments like caravans, tent roofs, and off-grid shelters.
